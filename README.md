# Rust for C++ Programmers

This gitbook is a collection of "Rust for C++ programmers" posts by Nick Cameron.

I found it a bit hard to read the posts on [his blog](http://featherweightmusings.blogspot.com/), hence I started copy-pasting them into a [git repo](https://github.com/aminb/rust-for-c) to make it easier to read. Of course, all the credit for content goes to [Nick Cameron](http://www.ncameron.org/).

After a while, I decided to turn them into a gitbook, so here it is!
